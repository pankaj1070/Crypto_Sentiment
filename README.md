Unit 12â€”Tales from the Crypto

Background
In this assignment, I applied natural language processing to explain the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. I also fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.

The assignment is divided into 3 parts:

Sentiment Analysis
Natural Language Processing
Named Entity Recognition

1. Sentiment Analysis

Newsapi was used to pull the latest news articles for Bitcoin and Ethereum.

From this data a DataFrame of sentiment scores for each coin was created.
